# CVE-2023-20198
CVE-2023-20198 Checkscript based on: https://blog.talosintelligence.com/active-exploitation-of-cisco-ios-xe-software/

The script checks length of returned response with code 200, and checks if length is shorter then 32 characters. Each IP returning shorter length than 32 chars should be checked to se if device is compromised. This script *only* gives you an indicator, not proof that the device is compromised.

The script also checks if the implant has been upgraded, as dicovered by Fox-IT: https://github.com/fox-it/cisco-ios-xe-implant-detection

```
python cve-2023-20198.py

IP: 10.0.0.94 - Error: no reply

IP: 10.0.0.96 - Status: 200

IP: 10.0.0.96 - Response is a potentially suspicious: 


IPs with status code 200, suspicious length, should be checked:

['10.0.0.96']

IPs with status code 200, but no IOC:

[]
